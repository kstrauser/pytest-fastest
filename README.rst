Use SCM and coverage to run only needed tests

----

This `pytest`_ plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter`_ along with `@hackebrot`_'s `cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_ template.


Features
--------

* Gathers coverage data from tests to track which tests call functions from which modules.
* Uses Git to track changes from a given commit to find the minimum set of tests that need to run to test new changes, then skips everything else.


Requirements
------------

* Python 3.7+
* pytest 3.4.0+


Installation
------------

You can install "pytest-fastest" via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::

    $ pip install pytest-fastest


Usage
-----

pytest-fastest can be set to run only tests:

* That test modules that have changed in Git,
* Tests that we don't already have coverage data for, and
* Tests that we've added or changed.

In most common development workflows where you make short-lived branches
off a main "master" or "dev" branch, the amount of code that actually
changes while fixing a bug or writing a feature is usually just a small
portion of the whole codebase. Instead of running thousands of tests
after each change, pytest-fastest can identify the relevant ones that
thoroughly test your work but skip all the things you *haven't* changed.

To use it:

* In ``pytest.ini``, set ``fastest_commit`` to the name of a Git commit to
  compare your current work against. (You can also set or override it on the
  command line with ``--fastest-commit``). This is required if you want to
  skip tests, which is the main reason for using this plugin.

* Use the command line argument ``--fastest-mode`` to choice the appropriate
  running mode:

  - ``all`` (default): Run all tests without collecting coverage data. This
    emulates normal pytest behavior and has no effect on performance.
  - ``skip``: Skip tests that don't need to be run, but update coverage data
    on the ones that do run. This will usually be faster than ``all``, but
    because collecting coverage information takes some time, as the number
    of un-skippable tests grows very large it may actually become slower.
  - ``gather``: Don't skip any tests, but do gather coverage data. This is
    slower than ``all`` but can be used to seed the coverage cache.
  - ``cache``: This is a fast mode for fixing existing tests. It skips tests
    but doesn't update the coverage cache. It will never be slower than
    ``all`` and will always be faster than ``skip``.

Contributing
------------
Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with `tox`_, please ensure
the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.
